\prefacesection{Acknowledgements}
As I was writing these lines of acknowledgements, it struck me that 5 years have already passed, blazingly fast but truly rewarding. 
At the beginning of my PhD, I thought it would be a long, painful multi-year period of my life (yes, there had been ups and downs!), but by the time I was close to finishing, my PhD duration became surprising short as I kept wandering: will I ever have a chance to live again in such a stimulating, inspiring, and caring environment with little pressure and full freedom for academic and personal development that Stanford and the CS department had offered? All of these will not be possible without the help of many people.

First and foremost, I would like to extend my deepest appreciation to my advisor, Chris Manning, whom I cannot find any point to complain about. Chris has given me so much inspiration for my academic career and provided me countless support including personal ones. Without him, I feel uncertain if I can make it all the way through my PhD and you can get sense of his hard word through this link \url{https://github.com/lmthang/thesis/issues} which documents all of his edits to my thesis, page by page.

I would also like to thank other members in thesis committee, Dan Jurafsky, Andrew Ng, Quoc Le, and Christopher Potts for providing detailed feedback to my thesis.
I would like to thank Quoc Le, Ilya Sutskever, Oriol Vinyals, and other colleagues at Google Brain who have inspired me to do research in deep learning. It was a fortunate turn of my life when interning at Google Brain in 2014 and 2015, with Quoc Le as my host, during which I have picked up on Neural Machine Translation!

I am grateful to my other collaborators (in chronological order) whom I have learned so much from: Richard Socher, Michael C. Frank, Mark Johnson, Wojciech Zaremba, Hieu Pham, Michael Kayser, Jiwei Li, Eudard Hovy, Lukasz Kaiser, Timothy O'Donnell, Noah Goodman, Kyunghuyn Cho, Abigail See, Joern Wuebker, Spence Green, John DeNero, and Sa\v{s}a Hasan. I would like to thank members of the Stanford NLP group which I am fortunate to be in; 5 years are simply too short to learn from all of you and I will definitely miss the many retreats, BBQs, paper proofreading sessions, NLP lunch, conference trips, etc., that we had together. I would like to thank friends in the CS department whom I always look up to and strive to be ``equally good''. I would like specifically thank Percy Liang for being in my qualifying exam committee and Russell Stewart for always enlightening me with his intelligence. I would like to thank staff in the Gates building who have been silently providing support for generations of successful students.

Certainly, life is meaningless without friends and family. I would like to thank all people whom I have been with me, encouraging me, and providing me unwavering support to finally complete this journey. These include Wendy Nguyen, Luan Nguyen, Edward Pham, Hanh Pham, Ca Truong, Hoan Nguyen, An Nguyen, Ngoc Do, Vu Van, Vy Van, Huong Ha, Cindy Au, Minh Thao Nguyen, Lan Huong Nguyen, Trang Nguyen, Huy Le, Thai Pham, Hai Vo, Thuc Vu, friends in the VietStan family, and many many others which I am grateful for.
Last but not least, I would like to thanks my parents, Binh Luong and Thuy Nguyen, as well as my dear brother, Toan Luong. They have been and will always be my strongest support!
