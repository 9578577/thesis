# Thang Luong's Thesis
Following my advisor Chris Manning's recent preference towards <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jakevdp/in-defense-of-extreme-openness">extreme openness</a>, I put my thesis online. Feel free to comment and encourage me to make progress!

The latest state of the thesis can be found <a
