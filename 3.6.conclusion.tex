We have shown that a simple alignment-based technique can mitigate and even
overcome one of the main weaknesses of current NMT systems, which is
their inability to translate words that are not in their vocabulary.  
A key advantage of our technique is the fact that it is applicable to any NMT system and not
only to the deep LSTM model of \newcite{sutskever14}.  A technique
like ours is likely necessary if an NMT system is to achieve state-of-the-art performance
on machine translation.

We have demonstrated empirically that on the WMT'14 English-French translation task, our technique yields a 
consistent and substantial improvement of up to \bestunkimp{} BLEU points over various NMT systems of different architectures. 
Most importantly, with \bestbleuunk{} BLEU points, we have established the first NMT system that outperformed 
the best MT system on a WMT'14 contest dataset.
